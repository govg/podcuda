#Proper Orthogonal Decomposition


####Balanced Model Reduction via POD

Author      :   K. Willcox, J. Peraire

Location    :   MIT

Combination of techniques, POD + Balanced realization theory. Also contains a
bit about method of snapshots.

####Overview of POD

Author      :   Gaetan Kerschen, Jean-Claude Golinval et al

Location    :   University of Liege, UIUC

Good introduction to POD. A survey paper, serves as a complete overview.

####PCA and ICA Tutorial

Author      :   NA

Location    :   Helsinki University of Technology

A lecture on PCA and ICA. Good insight into mathematics involved as well
as the differences between the various names used to describe POD.


####Dimensionality Reduction

Author      :   Qian Du, James E Fowler, Ben Ma

Location    :  Mississippi State University

Usage of PCA in target detection. Also includes a technique called random
projection. A small part also deals with using GPUs.


####Parallel PCA

Author      :   W.Liu et al

Location    :   China University of Petroleum

Anchor paper. Contains good work on PCA on GPU, as well as some related
benchmarking tools.



####POD and Applcations - NUS

Author      :   Y.C.Liang, H.P.Lee et. al.

Location    :   National University of Singapore


Good overview of subtle differences in the different decompositions. Also
contains analysis of performance of various decompositions, as well as
relevant derivations.

####PCA for Large Datasets

Author      :   Carlos Ordonez, Naveen Mohanam, Carlos Garcia-Alvarado

Location    :   University of Houston, Texas

Computes PCA in one pass on a large data set. Good technical overview, goes
into good bit of detail about the implementations.

####Parallel POD

Author      :   Giancarlo Alfonsi, Leonardo Primavera

Location    :   University of Calabria, Italy

CPU based parallelism for the POD. Very old paper, slightly irrelevant and
outdated benchmarks. But could serve as another anchor paper.


####Introduction to POD - IISc

Author      :   Anindya Chatterjee

Location    :   Penn State University / IISc


The main tutorial to POD. Very well written, with good references. Must get
this in the head.

####PCA Tutorial - Google Research

Author      :   Jonathon Shlens

Location    :   Google Research, Mountain View

Very good introduction and overview to the statistical background of PCA.
Contains sample code as well.


####POD Tutorial - Rice University

Author      :   Saifon Chaturantabut, Dr Sorensen

Location    :   Rice University

Lecture on POD, with emphasis on the differential equations and related
approach.

####POD Overview - CERFRACS

Author      :   Katrin Grau, Laurent Gicquel

Location    :   CERFRACS, France

Internship report on application of POD to flows. Student written paper,
so has the characteristic informality as well as the lack of depth in
material. But good for a casual read.


####Model Reduction via POD

Author      :   David Amsallem, Charbel Farhat

Location    :   Stanford University

Lecture slides on method of snapshots, POD, and SVD. Slightly off track, but
should be read.
