{"name":"Podcuda","tagline":"POD library on CUDA","body":"##PODCUDA\r\n\r\nThis library aims to be a CUDA based implementation of the POD.\r\n\r\n###POD (Proper Orthogonal Decomposition)\r\n\r\n[POD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_components_analysis) or Proper Orthogonal Decomposition is a tool used in data analysis.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn simple terms, it works by generating a lower dimensional approximate of\r\nnoisy high dimensional data. It is closely related to PCA, SVD and a lot of\r\nother such methods\r\n\r\n###CUDA\r\n\r\n[CUDA]( http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html) or Compute Unified Device Architecture, is a parallel computing platform\r\ncreated by NVIDIA corp. It allows using general GPUs present in mid-high end\r\ncomputers for computation. The advantage of using this over traditional CPU\r\nbased computation is that there are generally around hundreds of compute cores\r\non a normal GPU. While current generation of GPUs do not allow better than\r\nsingle (double in case of high end) precision computation, it still is good\r\nenough for a lot of trivially parallelizable computation.\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\nThe primary focus of this library will be ease of use, and speed. CUDA does\r\nhave its limitations, and I will try to work around it as much as it allows.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe target is to be finished with single precision computation in the coming\r\nmonth, so that work on double precision versions can be started by the start\r\nof October.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr>\r\n\r\n###Related work and references : \r\n\r\nRelated decompositions : \r\n\r\n* [Eigen Decomposition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition#Eigendecomposition)\r\n* [K-L Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karhunen%E2%80%93Lo%C3%A8ve_theorem)\r\n\r\nHelpful tutorials and introductions : \r\n\r\n* http://web.stanford.edu/~amsallem/CA-CME345-Ch4.pdf\r\n* http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/apr102000/tutorial2.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nFor queries, contact me at govind.93@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nI also lurk on Quakenet and Freenode, govg in both.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
