 I'm not good with licenses and stuff. Basically, if you get any of the
 code here up and running, feel free to use it. But please don't distribute
 it as your own work. Give me/others credit where it is due. If you plan on
 using podcuda in an academic setting, please wait till the project is
 officialy over / till I release a statement saying development has reached
 a stable release point.
